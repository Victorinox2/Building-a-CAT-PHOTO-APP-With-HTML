In this Responsive Web Design Certification, i learnt about the language that developers use to build webpages: HTML(Hypertext Markup Language) for content, and CSS(Cascading Style Sheets) for design.

To learn the basics of HTML, i built a Cat Photo App.

HTML tags give a webpage its structure. HTML tags can be used to add photos, buttons, and other elements to your webpages.
